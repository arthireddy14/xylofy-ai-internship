# 📈 End-to-End Sales Forecasting & Demand Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my **Week 3 & Week 4 AI & Data Science Internship at XYlofy AI**.

The objective was to build a complete demand intelligence system capable of forecasting future sales, detecting unusual sales behavior, segmenting products based on demand, and providing an interactive business dashboard.

The project simulates a real-world retail demand forecasting system similar to those used by companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Flipkart.

# 📊 Best Forecasting Model

Three forecasting models were evaluated.

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE |
|------|------:|------:|------:|
| SARIMA | 18031.40 | 19009.18 | 0.1897 |
| Prophet | 20250.79 | 22318.41 | 0.2186 |
| **XGBoost** | **14537.39** | **17093.03** | **0.1459** |

**Selected Model:** XGBoost

It achieved the lowest forecasting error and produced the most accurate predictions.
